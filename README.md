Overview
This manual is a guide for using the Google Cloud TPU in Zhuang's group at Princeton University.

TPUs are specialized high-performance computing resources optimized for large-scale machine learning workloads. We have access to multiple TPU generations and topologies, including v3, v4, v5e, and v6e pods, with both preemptible and on-demand configurations available depending on quota and project access.
